# Numerical Methods Project
Numerical methods project using Python (averages, trapezoidal integration, differentiation).

## Context
This project was developed as part of the Algorithm and Programming course, where implementations were completed individually and later discussed in a group setting.

## Description
This project implements fundamental numerical methods using explicit loops, including:
- Average calculation of 2D matrices
- Trapezoidal numerical integration
- Central difference differentiation
- Seismic signal analysis (acceleration, velocity, displacement, and jerk)

The seismic analysis processes real acceleration data recorded during an earthquake and generates plots and output files as required by the course.

## Files
- `promedio.py`  
  Computes the average of a 2D matrix (total, by row, by column).

- `area_trapezoidal.py`  
  Computes the area under a curve using the trapezoidal method.

- `pendiente_central.py`  
  Computes slopes using the central difference method.

- `seismic_analysis.py`  
  Main script that reads seismic data and generates plots.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
